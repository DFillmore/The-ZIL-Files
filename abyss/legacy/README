A few notes on the walk-thru version of The Abyss.
 
The game currently supports only the correct instructions to
make it through to the end. Doing something other than what is
required may result in unexpected results (and may void the
warranty).
 
Two 'cheat' verbs are required to get through the game. When you
oxygen in the breathing mix gets low, or when the nitrogen level
is high, after solving the stopper puzzle, you must use the $AIR
command to restore to breathing mix to nominal values. Also,
when you trap Coffey in the compression chamber, you must use
the $NITROGEN command to get him to say the wiring code
mnemonic.
 
When the crane crashes, you have enough time to do all the
things yourself, and in fact cannot ask anyone else to do
something for you.
 
The helium descrambler puzzle is not yet implemented.
