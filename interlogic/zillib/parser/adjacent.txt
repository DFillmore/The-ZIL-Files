Here is the standard method for the (new) parser to find objects in
adjacent rooms, if the author so desires.  The goal is to avoid this
kind of situation:

	221-B Baker Street

	You are standing in the spill of a gas streetlight outside
	Holmes's house.

	...

	>LOOK THROUGH WINDOW
	You look down into Baker Street.

	>EXAMINE STREETLIGHT
	You cannot see any streetlight here.

The author has to do two things for any such method to work:
 (1) declare what rooms are adjacent to a given one, and
 (2) declare what verbs should look for objects in adjacent rooms.

Here is my proposal (ahem):

(1) The player can see into adjacent rooms if HERE has an ADJACENT
    property whose value is a LTABLE of bytes containing pairs: the name
    of an adjacent room and whether that room is visible from here at the
    moment.  (Maybe it's hidden behind a closed door.)  If all the adjacent
    rooms are always visible from here, the LTABLE should be pure.
    The main ZIL file for the game must include <ORDER-OBJECTS? ROOMS-FIRST>,
    and the number of rooms must not exceed 255.
    In the example, the author would write:

	<ROOM HOLMES-STUDY
	      (ADJACENT <TABLE (LENGTH BYTE) BAKER-STREET T>)
	      ...>

	<COND (<SET TMP1 <INTBL? ,BAKER-STREET
				 <REST <SET TMP2
					    <GETP ,HOLMES-STUDY ,P?ADJACENT>>
				       1>
				 <GETB .TMP2 0>
				 1>>
	       <PUTB .TMP1 1 0>)>	;"window shade closed"

    Note: This property duplicates information from the CORRIDOR property
    in the mysteries.  But does anyone plan to use CORRIDOR in the future?

(2) The player can use a verb (syntax) on an object in an adjacent room
    if the syntax has a special combination of bits following OBJECT.
    (A single bit would be tidier, but none is available.)  The special
    combination is one that will never occur otherwise; I propose the
    combination (HAVE EVERYWHERE).  (By the way, I took a census of the
    OBJECT bits actually used in Shogun and Zork Zero.  See P:SYNTAX.CENSUS.)
    In the example, the author would write:

	<SYNTAX EXAMINE OBJECT (HAVE EVERYWHERE) = V-EXAMINE PRE-EXAMINE>

    Note: If the adjacent room itself has a SYNONYM or ADJECTIVE property,
    and the author wants the player to be able to refer to it (for
    example, ENTER BAKER STREET), then it should appear in the GLOBAL
    property of HERE.
