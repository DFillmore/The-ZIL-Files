PLURAL NOUNS:

Suppose you have two keys in your game, and the player acquires them
both.  Then the command EXAMINE KEYS should be interpreted as meaning
both keys.

The Right Thing is to create a plural noun, with the form

	<NEW-ADD-WORD "KEYS" NOUN <VOC "KEY"> ,PLURAL-FLAG>

in any file after the parser files (or at least after PDEFS).
The plural noun should NOT appear in the SYNONYM list of either key.
When the parser looks for a KEYS object and fails to find one,
it will notice the PLURAL-FLAG and re-interpret the phrase as ALL KEYS.
Then it will find both keys, and call PERFORM for each one.

Note: The parser must first fail to find a KEYS object before
assuming ALL.  This feature allows you to implement, for example,
FRENCH DOORS as well as singular DOORs.
