HOW TO USE QUERIES AND STATEMENTS IN THE PARSER -- Stu Galley 17-Aug-88

1. What can the user type? ----------------------------------------------------

(a) One kind of valid sentence is a statement in the form:

	subject verb [preposition] [first object] [preposition] [second object]

where items in brackets are optional.  The astute reader will notice
that this looks exactly like a typical command in any one of our
interactive fictions, except that there is a subject, and the verb is
not in the imperative mood.  In fact, the sentence is handled like a
typical command, because the parser, in effect, adds a comma after the
subject, and changes the verb to imperative mood.  Examples:

	THE TROLL ATTACKS ME becomes TROLL, ATTACK ME
	I SEARCH FOR A CLUE  becomes SEARCH FOR A CLUE

(b) Another kind of valid sentence has the form:

	subject be-verb [NOT] [BE] predicate

where "be-verb" is either AM, ARE, IS, WAS, WERE, WILL, or SHALL; and
"predicate" is a noun phrase, an adjective, or a prepositional phrase.

Examples:
	MY NAME IS ARTHUR DENT
	I AM NOT A CROOK
	YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY
	WE ARE FROM FRANCE

(c) Other kinds of valid sentences are questions in these forms:

	question-word be-verb subject

	[question-word] be-verb subject [NOT] [BE] predicate

where "question-word" is either WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHO, WHOM, WHY, or HOW.

Examples:
	WHAT IS A GRUE
	WHEN IS LUNCH
	WHY WILL I NOT BE SORRY
	IS THE POPE CATHOLIC

(d) Or in this form:

	[question-word] can-word subject [NOT] command

where "can-word" is either CAN, COULD, DO, MAY, MIGHT, WILL, WOULD,
SHOULD, or MUST (or their inflections); and "command" is a typical
command.

Examples:
	WHERE WILL WE EAT
	CAN YOU OPEN THE DOOR
	DOES A BEAR SHIT IN THE WOODS
	WHY DID THE CHICKEN CROSS THE ROAD
